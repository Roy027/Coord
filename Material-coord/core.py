class Benchmark:
    """
    Class for performing coordination number benchmarks on a set of structures
    using different nearest neighbor methods.

    Args:
        structures: A set of structures. Should be given as a dictionary of
            ``{"name": Structure}``. The structures should be decorated
            with a "coordination" property on each site specifying the correct
            coordination environment. For example, if a site is bonded to
            two oxygen and three chlorine atoms, the coordination property
            should be a dictionary of ``{"O": 2, "Cl": 3}``. If multiple
            coordination numbers are deemed correct these should be provided
            as a list. For example, if the coordination to gallium could be
            4 or 12 coordinate, the coordination property should a dictionary
            of ``{"Ga": [4, 12]}``.
        symprec: If not None, the benchmark will use symmetry to reduce
            the number of sites for which the coordinate number is calculated.
            symprec is the symmetry precision in Angstrom.
        perturb_sigma: If not None, this will enable the
            Einstein crystal test rig mode. Each site will be displaced
            according a normal distribution with the width equal to
            perturb_sigma. The perturbation complies thus with the expectation
            for an Einstein crystal, in which the potential is given by
            V(dr) = 1/2 * kspring * (dr)^2. kspring denotes the spring constant
            with which the sites are tethered to their equilibrium position, and
            dr is the distance of the site under consideration from its
            equilibrium position.
        remove_oxidation_states: Remove oxidation states from structures before
            performing the benchmark. As oxidation states will not always be known,
            any near neighbor methods that require oxidation states (i.e.,
            MinimumVIRENN) should include a method to assign oxidation states
            automatically. Setting this option to False allows testing whether the
            automatic assignment of oxidation states will itself impact performance.
            Furthermore, some methods, such as CrystalNN, have slightly different
            behaviour if oxidation states are present. Again this option enables
            testing this behaviour.
        reciprocal_coordination: Several near neighbor methods are not reciprocal. I.e.,
            if site A is bonded to site B, it is not guaranteed that site B is bonded
            to site A. Enabling this option ensures that coordination is reciprocal by
            evaluating the coordination of all sites and including all bonds. This
            behaviour is the same as that provided by NearNeighbor.get_bonded_structure.
